## Professional Summary

I am a software architect with **18+ years of experience** designing and implementing **high-performance, concurrent, and network-centric systems**, primarily in **embedded and Linux environments**.

My work focuses on **system design, kernel and userspace interaction, protocol behavior, and scalability under real-world constraints**. I am most effective when working close to the system — where correctness, performance, and failure handling matter more than abstractions and frameworks.

---

## Core Technical Focus
- Linux (Ubuntu as daily development environment)
- Kernel-adjacent and low-level systems programming
- Userspace networking and control-plane software
- Embedded and carrier-grade environments
- **C / C++** — primary languages, used for performance-critical and system-level components
- Python — used for tooling, automation, and prototyping
- concurrency from a **design-first perspective**, not trial-and-error.

## Networking Expertise

My primary networking expertise is in **routing and control-plane design**, with deep experience in:

- **OSPF**
  - Protocol behavior and state machines
  - Building systems *on top of OSPF*
  - Extending and integrating OSPF into larger control-plane architectures

- **BGP** — currently exploring for inter-domain and large-scale routing scenarios
- **VXLAN** — learning and evaluating overlay networking designs

Focus on **how protocols behave under scale, failure, and concurrency**, not just their happy-path specifications.

## What This Site Is

This site is a **technical notebook and reference**, not a generic blog.

Here I document:
- Architecture decisions
- Protocol behavior
- System-level design trade-offs
- Performance and concurrency lessons

Content is written for engineers/leaders who care about **how systems actually work**.
